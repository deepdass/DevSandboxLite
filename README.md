THIS IS A LITE VERSION OF REPO - https://github.com/deepdass/DevSandbox In terms of Repo size 
<br>This Repo Does not have full commit history to reduce size, check orignal for that



# DevSandbox
A multiplayer gameplay sandbox focused on modular, data-driven systems, AI, networking and performance.
<br> Planning to make this into a evergrowing sandbox containing my game dev shenanigans.

## How to Run the Unreal Project Files
To get the Unreal project running on your system, first clone this github repo into a local folder using git or just download the zip by tapping the green code on top.
<br> Then Download the Unreal 5.7 version from Epic games launcher as the game was made on that version, you could also use the latest version - but things may break during compiling. 
<br> Then locate the zip and unzip it, you will find .uproject file, right click it -> more options -> 'generate Visual Studio project files' -> open up the .sln in Rider or Visual Studio Community and press Ctrl + Shift + B on load, 
<br> Let it compile and launch it but tapping uproject or the play button - and you have the project files.

## Project Structure
- See Source files here - [Source](Source/Projectidk), Every header/implementation files are in their own subfolders with flat split. (e.g. [Save Game Subsystem](Source/Projectidk/SaveSystem), [Action System](Source/Projectidk/ActionSystem))
- Pure/C++ inherited blueprint classes are inside [Core directory](Content/Core) inside content folder with their own subfolders
- Game Art Assets - [Content](Content)
- Configs Engine, Game specific including Gameplay Tags - [Configs](Config)
- Custom/ Open Source Plugins - [Plugins](Plugins)

## Why
I wanted to get better at writing modular, component-based architecture in C++ alongside Unreal replication and multiplayer, while keeping things performant and actually understand how these systems work together
